# Probabilistic Robotics: practice
This contains C/C++ code to simulate Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques. Although it is initially my old code which I wrote for my master study, I will update with newer stuff.

There are three programs which all simulate 3D navigation like an underwater robot with holonomic control.
- [prog_EKF](./prog_EKF): Extended Kalman Filter
- [prog_GL](./prog_GL): Grid Localization
- [prog_FastSLAM](./prog_FastSLAM): Fast SLAM
